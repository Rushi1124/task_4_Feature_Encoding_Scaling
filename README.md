## Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling
# Dataset: Adult Income Dataset

# Steps Performed
Loaded and cleaned the dataset by handling missing values.
Identified categorical and numerical features.
Applied label encoding to the target variable (income).
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features without order.
Standardized numerical features using mean and standard deviation.
Saved the preprocessed dataset for model training.
# Why Encoding & Scaling?
Encoding converts categorical data into numerical form required by ML models.
Scaling ensures all numerical features contribute equally and improves model performance.
# Algorithms That Need Scaling
Logistic Regression
KNN
SVM
K-Means
PCA
# Deliverables
Preprocessed dataset: adult_income_processed.csv
Jupyter Notebook with pandas and numpy–based preprocessing code
# Outcome
Dataset is fully model-ready.
Understanding of feature engineering basics achieved.
